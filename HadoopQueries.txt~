QUESTION : Find out the frequency of books published each year.
Answer:  Should result in 114 unique records and 115 if YearOfPublication =0 is included

QUESTION : Find out in which year maximum number of books were published
Answer : 17,628 - This job runs 2 jobs in hadoop (first to count of all and then limits to 1)

samples from web

SELECT actor_id, movie_id, movie_release_date
FROM movies
WHERE group_count(movie_id) = 0
DISTRIBUTE BY actor_id
SORT BY actor_id, movie_release_date

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col_A) AS colA_count
FROM table_a;

then is this the correct optimized query?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM
( SELECT col_A 
FROM table_a
WHERE group_count(col_B) = 0
DISTRIBUTE BY col_A
) a;

select count(*)
from
( select actor_id, movie_id
  from movies
  distribute by actor_id
  where group_count(movie_id) = 0
) a;

select actor_id, movie_id, movie_release_date
from movies
distribute by actor_id
sort by actor_id, movie_release_date
where group_count(movie_id) = 0;

Hive doesn't support NOT IN patterns in sub query. So we can't run this following query:

select actor_id
from table1
where NOT actor_id IN 
  ( select actor_id
    from table2
  );
  
  To achieve the set difference, we have to get a little more creative:
  
  select t1.actor_id
  from 
  ( select actor_id
    from table1
  ) t1
  left outer join 
  ( select actor_id
    from table2
  ) t2
  on (t1.actor_id = t2.actor_id)
  where t2.actor_id is null;
Rows where successful joins are possible will have a non-null entry and this way they will be filtered out. The left outer join will make sure all entries from table1 are included and rows from table2 are filtered out.
